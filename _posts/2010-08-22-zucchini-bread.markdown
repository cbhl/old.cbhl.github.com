Made zucchini bread today using [the recipe I found on
Google[0]](http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/moms-zucchini-bread/Detail.aspx).
I think I added a good deal more zucchini than called for in the recipe
but it still came out okay. Also used a mix of 1 cup white sugar and 1
1/2 cups packed brown sugar (for a total of 2 1/2 cups sugar) and
reduced cinnamon to 1 tsp.

**Baking Tip:**It's okay to bake with pans which are different sizes
(e.g. different length and width but same depth) provided they are the
same type of pan (e.g. both dark glass pans). Make sure that the same
level of batter is in each one. (You may need to adjust the baking time
from the one in the recipe.)
