I've updated my resume for CECS and JobMine - if, for whatever reason,
you don't have CSS on, you'll get this nicer plain-text version of my
resume. **Edit:** There is one caveat to this -- this change (hack?) is
intended to work around uglyness when printing the resume with CSS off.
(Who prints resumes with CSS off? Apparently
[CECS](http://cecs.uwaterloo.ca/) is known to do so for recruiters
visiting campus.) However, if you're actually relying on graceful
degradation (e.g. with lynx, elinks, or a screen reader) you'll suffer a
suboptimal experience as the resume will show up twice -- once in this
pre-formatted block, and once with the original gracefully-degrading
version.
