I wrote two articles for UW's frosh week -- one introducing Software
Engineering in the Iron Warrior, and one with general advice in
mathNEWS. Since mathNEWS has been having issues with their online
archives, I will have to wait until a later date to publish my article
(when I can retype it or figure out how to find a digital copy of the
version the Editors published). Alas. After I wrote this blurb, [CSCF
adjusted their policy to assign students mailservices email
accounts](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/student/email/ChangeFall2010)
rather than accounts on their own student.cs mail server. As a result,
SE students now only have two emails from the university to manage,
instead of the three I lament in the article as published. This is
definitely a positive step -- mailservices gives much larger quotas than
the old student.cs server, and it also can be accessed via IMAP (yay).
Of course, there's still the plethora of SSH and RDP/Terminal Servers
available for one to access... for better or worse. But that discussion
is best left to another article... or to the various wiki pages you can
find using Google. And I'm still waiting for at least one software frosh
to come say hi. Perhaps I should spend more time in the labs on campus?
