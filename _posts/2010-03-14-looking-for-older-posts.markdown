I've updated my website to the latest stable version of WordPress (as of
the time of writing) and decided to give it a bit of an overhaul. If
you're looking for old content (basically anything from high school),
try looking through the archived copy of my old site at:
http://old.azuresky.ca/ With the transition to University comes new
opportunities and new projects... and hopefully I'll have enough time to
actually put useful projects on this website.
