1.  I'm a guy.
2.  I have black hair.
3.  I have glasses.
4.  I'm of east asian descent. Even though I only can speak English
    fluently.
5.  I suck at taking self-photos.
6.  I spend most of my days in rooms with fluorescent lighting.
7.  I have a big nose.
8.  I don't usually smile. Especially for photos.
9.  When I wear a tie, it usually comes out asymmetrical.
10. When I wear a tie in a classroom, it usually means I have (had) a
    job interview that day.
11. I don't know how to iron a shirt. As a result, all of my shirts are
    wrinkled.
12. I tend to have my mouth (at least partially) open. Even in photos.
13. I own a striped blue tie. I got it from Wal-Mart in a two-pack of
    ties.
14. My hair is short. Mom usually cuts my hair.
15. I don't take pictures of myself very often. (This picture is almost
    a month old.)
