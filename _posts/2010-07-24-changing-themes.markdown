WordPress 3.0 has made some fundamental changes which make [Child
Themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) a better option than
ever... which means instead of running customized but outdated themes
all the time I can keep up-to-date and override only the bits I want to.
But this also means I have to make a mess of my site to take advantage
of this, so don't expect any stability with respect to themes in the
near future. Once I settle on something, you'll see a new post on my
blog.
