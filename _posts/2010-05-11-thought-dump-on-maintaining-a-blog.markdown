Today, signed in to realize that there were eleven unmoderated comments.
Of these, nine were spam, and two were comments from the same person.
Now, I'm wondering:
-   How am I going to find time to write regular blog posts?
-   Will the content I write about interest anyone other than myself?
    (Will I be interested in it, even?)
-   Why didn't I get e-mail notifications for my blog comments?
-   Should I post remarks about my experiences with PDEng 15 on my blog?
    How relevant will they be if PDEng is to be renamed (replaced?) in
    the next few years?
-   Do I spend too much time at home thinking about work? Is this
    healthy? Should I do anything about it? Can I?
-   What role do coding contests like Google Code Jam have in my life?
    What role should they have?
-   When am I ever going to get around to separating my friends between
    high-traffic and low-traffic Facebook and Twitter accounts, and when
    will I ever update my resume and LinkedIn profiles?

So, why is this here? Because it's too long to fit in a
[tweet](http://twitter.com/cbhl).
