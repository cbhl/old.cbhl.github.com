Something I learned from Mom: \
 Cold mutes the flavors in the salad, so while it's still warm the
flavour should be a little too strong.

Something I learned from the 'Net: Try grating in the hard boiled egg.

Something I learned last time I made salad that I applied here: a large
bowl is not optional.

Something I learned when I made this today: no matter how big the chunks
are when you start, the potato lumps will become smaller as you mix the
salad.
