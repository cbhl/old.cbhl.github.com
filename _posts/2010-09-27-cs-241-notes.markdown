Where do we store value of $31 during fcn calls?\
 Approach 1: Store as part of program.\
 - Goes wrong with recursion.\
 Approach 2: LIFO / Stack\
 - Grow from bottom of memory\
 - $30 contains first byte address following our program's memory area\
 - Don't worry about heap for now.\
 "PUSH $R"\
 sw $R, -4($30)\
 lis $R\
 .word 4\
 sub $30, $30, $R\
 - first push with -4 so we can use same reg to increment stack pointer\
 "POP $R"\
 lis $R\
 .word 4\
 add $30, $30, $R\
 lw $R, -4($30)\
 - decrement stack pointer first so we can do the add in the register
about to load into
