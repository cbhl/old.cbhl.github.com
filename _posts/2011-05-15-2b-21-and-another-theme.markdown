Stuff that happened over the last six months (roughly chronological):
-   Finished 2A exams.
-   Spent hristmas and New Year's with Katherine and my family.
-   Flew YYZ-SFO and started work term at Facebook.
-   Discovered Pandora, Spotify, and Netflix.
-   Visited the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA.
-   Visited a Facebook Data Centre.
-   Went to Stitches West with [another intern at
    Facebook](http://www.thepurpleparadox.com/).
-   Was dumped via email <3.
-   Filed US and Canadian Taxes.
-   Ate out way too much.
-   Flew SFO-YYZ to head back to Waterloo for Spring term.
-   Participated in [VeloCity Venture Fund: the
    Beta](http://startupnorth.ca/2011/05/06/the-velocity-venture-fund/)
    -- top 7 with [Skylark](http://skylark.iterate.ca/) with a team of
    five people.
-   Missed Google Code Jam's Qualifying Round.
-   Handed in my second work report.
-   Became an Academic Representative, MEF Representative, and SE Board
    Student Representative over the course of a week.
-   Had my 21st birthday.
-   Began the job search process with CECS/UWaterloo again.
-   Gave up on my WordPress theme again and tweaked the WordPress
    default theme to yield this monstrosity.

Over the past six months, I've discovered that I suck working in open
floor plan environments, that results-oriented is a double-edged sword,
and that I really need to find work that I'm really passionate about.
Way too many photos from the co-op term; about half way through I gave
up trying to manage / upload them to Facebook, let alone to this blog. I
don't think flickr is the answer, but I'm not sure what is, since I
don't personally own a Mac (== no iPhoto).
