Took various random photos while moving into Waterloo... but since I'm
too tired, I don't want to try and put them all into a WordPress post.
Clearly I need to find some middle-ground for photo management between
WordPress and Facebook... and I can't be bothered to think of a unique
username to use for a Yahoo account so that I could use flickr. Arghh.
Here's a photo of my door in the meantime, until I can get around to
picking out decent-looking photos from the rest of the set. (Posted this
one from the web interface instead of my phone, so you can click to
enlarge.)
