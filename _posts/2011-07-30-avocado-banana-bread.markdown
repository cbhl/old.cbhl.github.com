Adapted from a recipe from [Reader's Digest
Canada](http://www.readersdigest.ca/food/recipes/breads-and-muffins/avocado-banana-bread)
This one didn't come out as well as I had hoped, so it still needs a
little tweaking. :/
-   Heat oven to **350 F (180 C)**
-   **Grease** pans or **muffin tins**.
-   In a medium bowl, combine dry ingredients: **3 cups flour**, **4 1/2
    tsp. baking powder**, **3/4 tsp. salt**.
-   In a large bowl, combine wet ingredients: **3 Avocados, pureed**,
    **3 bananas, mashed**, **1 1/8 cup sugar + 1/4 cup water** (or use 1
    1/8 cups honey like the original recipe), **1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
    extract**.
-   Fold **dry mixture** into the **wet mixture**; spread evenly into
    muffin tins.
-   **Bake** until toothpick comes out clean (maybe \~30 min).
