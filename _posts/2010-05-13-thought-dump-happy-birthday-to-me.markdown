So, today's my birthday... and it's (nearly) almost over. The cheesecake
brownie "cake" that my family made for me was awesome, and I thoroughly
enjoyed eating slices of it. :D Thanks also to the people who wished me
Happy Birthday. Notably, the breakdown is as follows: Facebook - over 60
people E-mail - two people Twitter - two people MSN - two people In
person - maybe my immediate family... perhaps the odd co-worker (but I'm
not sure about this one) It's amazing how Facebook has taken over so
much in our lives. I've reached the point where I don't trust Facebook
with my stuff, but I can't afford to disconnect (i.e. delete my account)
either. What a dilemma... And this is just one of the many things to
worry about now that I'm 20. Not that I feel any older than I did
yesterday.
