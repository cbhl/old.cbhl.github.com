I've been using this app for a while now to upload photos. Two things
have been bugging me about it:

-   The app shows up as a share target when I select multiple photos in
    the gallery but crashes when I try to select more than one photo at
    a time. I can work around the issue by opening WordPress first and
    adding the images one at a time, but that's silly and involves more
    tapping.
-   When I upload a post and there's no network connection, I get a
    cryptic error message. Then I go d'oh and turn on 3G data.

I guess these silly expectations come from reading the apple iOS
developer docs too much. The latter (friendly "you have no internets"
messages) is required for app approval, IIRC.

I might go about writing patches later if I can find time.
