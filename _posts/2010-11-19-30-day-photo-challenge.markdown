Knowing me, I'm going to definitely miss a day or interpret the rules
wrong. I'm gonna give it a shot anyway. Day 01 - A picture of yourself
with fifteen facts. Day 02 - A picture of you and the person you have
been close with for a while. Day 03 - A picture of the cast from your
favorite show. Day 04 - A picture of your night. Day 05 - A picture of
your favorite memory. Day 06 - A picture of a person you'd love to trade
places with for a day. Day 07 - A picture of your most treasured item.
Day 08 - A picture that makes you laugh. Day 09 - A picture of the
person who has gotten you through the most. Day 10 - A picture of the
person you do the most fucked up things with. Day 11 - A picture of
something you hate. Day 12 - A picture of something you love. Day 13 - A
picture of your favorite band or artist. Day 14 - A picture of someone
you could never imagine your life without. Day 15 - A picture of
something you want to do before you die. Day 16 - A picture of someone
who inspires you. Day 17 - A picture of something that has made a huge
impact on your life recently. Day 18 - A picture of your biggest
insecurity. Day 19 - A picture of you when you were little. Day 20 - A
picture of somewhere you'd love to travel. Day 21 - A picture of
something you wish you could forget. Day 22 - A picture of something you
wish you were better at. Day 23 - A picture of your favorite book. Day
24 - A picture of something you wish you could change. Day 25 - A
picture of your day. Day 26 - A picture of something that means a lot to
you. Day 27 - A picture of yourself and a family member. Day 28 - A
picture of something you're afraid of. Day 29 - A picture that can
always make you smile. Day 30 - A picture of someone you miss.
